# Kotlin simple stuff

This project gives a simple overview of some of the basic stuff of Kotlin like:
* Null safety
* Data classes
* Usage of named abd default parameters in functions

Please also refer to my blog here [Soumik's blog on why use Kotlin](https://msoumik78.github.io/java/2019/05/30/lets-meet-kotlin.html)

### Dependencies

* Java 8 should be installed and available in the system. JAVA_HOME environment variable should be set and pointing to the location of Java 8.
* An IDE like - Intellij IDEA should be available and installed in the system with Kotlin support built in.


### Running program

*Kotlin can also be run from command line but it is best advisable to run it using the community edition of Intellij *
